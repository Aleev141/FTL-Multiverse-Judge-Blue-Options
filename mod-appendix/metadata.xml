This mod modifies the Node 17 judge event to turn options not yet shown to them blue.
Specifically, it removes the judge boon event and re-adds it.
Supports:
	Multiverse (5.4.5)
	Forgotten Diamonds (1.6.3)
	Forgotten Races (16.27)
	Forgemaster (0.6.1.2.2)
	Insurrection + Selection (5.4)
	C&C Weapons: Renegade (4.6)
	Fishier Than Light (1.2.2)
	Darkest Desire (2.2.0)

Any other mods that also modify boons will need to be loaded after this mod.
Let me know about them and I can add support!

This mod should be loaded after the supported mods, but before any unsupported boon adders.

EX:
Multiverse Assets/Data
Forgotten Races Assets/Data <=(supported)
Forgotten Races Diamonds <=(supported)
Judge Blue Options <=(This mod)
Some other boons mod <=(unsupported)
